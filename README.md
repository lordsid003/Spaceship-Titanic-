# Spaceship-Titanic
## DESCRIPTION:
The task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To make these predictions, we're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.
* Datasets include: Training Data, Testing Data and Submission Format
* The model is trained using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) created using Tensorflow:
  - Sequential model
  - Binary Classification => Sigmoid Activation function
  - Adam Optimizer
  - Binary Cross-entropy loss function
* Processes undertaken to train the model:
  -  Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
  -  Feature Engineering and Extraction
  -  Data Visualization
  -  Data Normalization and creating training dataset
  -  Model Training
  -  Saving the model
  -  Loading the saved model to make predictions
* Training Accuracy: 90.2% (8693 training examples with multiple features)
* Testing Accuracy (on Kaggle): 76%
